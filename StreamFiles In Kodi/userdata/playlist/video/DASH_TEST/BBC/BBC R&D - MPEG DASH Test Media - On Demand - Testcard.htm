MPEG DASH Test Media

  BBC DASH Testcard Stream

1 hour on demand stream

Return to main index <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/>

    Description

The Testcard MPEG DASH on-demand test stream has been designed to
provide a useful resource for verifying the behaviour of DASH clients.

It is based upon, and compliant with the DVB DASH profile (signalled
with profiles "urn:dvb:dash:profile:dvb-dash:2014" and
"dvb:dash:profile:dvb-dash:isoff-ext-live:2014").

The stream consists of both audio and video representations, with
synchronisation between those indicated within the media. The video
representations contain inband events, which also contain data which is
synchronised to the video.

The video streams contain Inband Event Streams using the Ball Position
event scheme <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/events/ballposition>. There are
also versions in the debugging section without events for use when
testing other aspects of DASH playback in clients which do not yet
support events.

    Main MPDs

These MPDs contain all the functionality of the test stream. The video
representations include events. There are two audio adaptation sets -
one containing the stereo representation and one containing the surround
representation.

  * MPD with all video and audio representations
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-events.mpd>
  * MPD with representations intended for Connected TV clients
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-ctv-events.mpd>
  * MPD which contains only audio
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-audio.mpd>

    Additional variants for specific test scenarios

The MPDs listed in this section use features which are not used in the
above streams, but may be used in real scenarios for a variety of
reasons. These streams should all play correctly in the same way as the
main MPDs, unless specifically noted.

      Streams with events in the audio representations

The audio track in this option is a stereo audio representation with
inband events. This may be useful for testing clients can interpret
events inband in the audio, and can discard duplicate events when the
same inband events are present in both audio and video representations.

  * MPD with video representations intended for Connected TV clients and
    stereo audio and inband events in only the audio representation
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-nosurround-ctv-events_on_audio.mpd>
  * MPD with video representations intended for Connected TV clients and
    stereo audio and inband events in both video and audio
    representations
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-nosurround-ctv-events_on_both.mpd>
  * MPD containing only a stereo audio representation with inband events
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-audio-events.mpd>

      Streams with presentationTimeOffset values

These streams use the presentationTimeOffset attribute in the
SegmentTemplates to correct an offset in the timeline in the media
segments. This is likely to be used where on demand MPDs are created
using content from a live stream.

The offset in the timeline is 10 minutes, in either both audio and
video, just the video, or in the case of the audio only stream just in
the audio. The stream duration is 20 minutes, and contains these
representations: 128kbps, 1280x720p50 and 704x396p25. When interpreted
correctly playback should start with a timecode of 00:00:00:00 and go up
to 00:20:01:23 and audio and video should be aligned correctly.

  * MPD with audio and video - with presentation time offset on both
    components
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-pto_both-events.mpd>
  * MPD with audio and video - with presentation time offset only on
    video
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-pto_video-events.mpd>
  * MPD with audio - with presentation time offset on that audio track
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-pto_audio.mpd>

      Streams with only relative BaseURLs and MPD redirects

The first stream here contains only relative BaseURLs in the MPD - this
tests the player's ability to correctly use the location of the MPD as
the default BaseURI when resolving relative URLs within the MPD.

The second stream has a redirect from the original MPD location to a new
MPD location - this tests the player's ability to correctly use the
final URL from which the MPD is retrieved as the default BaseURI when
resolving relative URLs within the MPD. When using this stream care must
be take to ensure that the URL to the MPD is copied from this page, and
not from a browser address bar after following the link (the browser may
have followed the redirect and then the player will not be tested).

  * MPD with no absolute BaseURL (CTV resolutions, stereo audio and no
    events)
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-nosurround-ctv-relative.mpd>
  * MPD which uses a redirect to the above MPD (ensure you copy this
    link to provide to a DASH player)
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/deadend/client_manifest-nosurround-ctv-relative.mpd>

      Streams with multiple language components

These streams also have French and German audio representations. The
first set have the additional languages marked with a role of "dub".
According to the DVB DASH profile (section 6.1.2) this indicates that
the alternative languages are translations from an English original.

The second set have all the languages marked as the "main" role. This
indicates (again according to the DVB Profile) that all the languages
are original, might be the case if commentaries for a sporting event
were given by people speaking different languages.

  * Multilanguage (as dub) MPD with all video and audio representations
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-events-multilang.mpd>
  * Multilanguage (as dub) MPD with Connected TV video and audio
    representations
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-ctv-events-multilang.mpd>
  * Multilanguage (as dub) MPD with Connected TV video and audio
    representations but no surround sound (only one audio adaptation set
    per language)
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-nosurround-ctv-multilang.mpd>

  * Multilanguage (all main) MPD with all video and audio
    representations
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-events-multimainlang.mpd>
  * Multilanguage (all main) MPD with Connected TV video and audio
    representations
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-ctv-events-multimainlang.mpd>
  * Multilanguage (all main) MPD with Connected TV video and audio
    representations but no surround sound (only one audio adaptation set
    per language)
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-nosurround-ctv-multimainlang.mpd>

    Additional variants for debugging purposes

Some additional formats and MPDs are available to assist in the
debugging of clients. These reduce the features used to make it easier
to identify what is causing problems for a client. However, as a result
of these changes, these do not represent streams which would be used in
a real service.

      Streams without events

This option uses video streams which do not include events. This may
assist in determining whether playback problems are caused by a client
not supporting events.

  * MPD without events and with all video and audio representations
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest.mpd>
  * MPD without events and with representations intended for Connected
    TV clients
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-ctv.mpd>

      Streams with only stereo audio

This option does not contain the adaptation set with surround audio.
This may assist in determining whether playback problems are caused by a
client not supporting two audio adaptation sets.

  * MPD without surround sound and with video representations intended
    for Connected TV clients
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-nosurround-ctv-events.mpd>
  * MPD without surround sound or events with video representations
    intended for Connected TV clients
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-nosurround-ctv.mpd>
  * MPD which contains only stereo audio
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-audio-nosurround.mpd>

      Streams without DVB extensions

This option does not include DVB specified extensions within the MPD.

  * MPD without DVB extensions and with all video and audio
    representations
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-events-nodvb.mpd>

    intended for Connected TV clients
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-ctv-nodvb.mpd>
  * MPD without DVB extensions or surround sound and with video
    representations intended for Connected TV clients
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-nosurround-ctv-events-nodvb.mpd>

    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-nosurround-nointerlace.mpd>

      Streams with only one video and one audio representation

This option has only a 1280x720p50 video representation and a stereo
audio representation.

  * MPD with 1 audio and 1 video representation
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-720p-stereo-events.mpd>
  * MPD with 1 audio and 1 video representation without events
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-720p-stereo.mpd>
  * MPD with 1 audio and 1 video representation without DVB extensions

  * MPD with 1 audio and 1 video representation wihtout DVB extensions
    or events
    <http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/dash/ondemand/testcard/1/client_manifest-720p-stereo-nodvb.mpd>

      Streams with 1kHz audio test tone

For investigating decoding problems a pure tone can be useful. These
streams have a single stereo representation as their audio component.
This contains a continuous 1kHz tone.

During playback the tone should not glitch, or change frequency.
Presentation time errors or decoder stalls (in either audio or video
decoders, or the clock synchronising them on hardware decoders) can
cause such errors.
